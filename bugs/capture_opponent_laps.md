it'd be rad to capture opponent laps when in multiplayer sessions, to analyse later.

this could get "out of control" quickly, so maybe just "the fastest lap from each opponent" so it doesn't build up too much?

MVP is obviously to capture all laps, and refine from there.

If we don't get actual inputs, taking whatever will let us build a "close enough" training signal would be enough.
