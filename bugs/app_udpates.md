it'd be cool if the app looked for updates and updated itself, from the github repo.

and it'd be cool if it ran in the system tray

and it'd be cool if it wrote telemetry into the ~/Documents/eztel/my_laps/ folder 

so if there was a little config menu where we could specify ~/Documents/eztel/ as the path to write to, that'd be cool
